# freeCodeCamp-Projects

Here you can find my solutions to the **Scientific Computing with Python Certification** projects offered by the **freeCodeCamp**. 

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter

Created a function that takes a list of arithmetic problems, formats them vertically and side-by-side, and optionally displays the answers

### 2. Budget App

Created a Python class, Category, which allows for the management of budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment by providing methods for deposits, withdrawals, balance retrieval, transfers, and fund checks, and also specifies a formatted display when printing the category's ledger.

### 3. Polygon Area Calculator

Created two Python classes, Rectangle and Square, where Square is a subclass of Rectangle. The Rectangle class includes methods for setting dimensions, calculating area, perimeter, diagonal, and creating a visual representation with "*" characters.

### 4. Probability Calculator

Created a Python program with a Hat class to simulate drawing balls from a hat and an experiment function to estimate the probability of achieving a specific combination of drawn balls in multiple experiments.

### 5. Time Calculator

Created a Python function, add_time, that takes a start time, a duration, and an optional starting day of the week, and calculates the resulting time while considering AM/PM and days elapsed, returning the formatted result.
