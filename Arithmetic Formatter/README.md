# Arithmetic Formatter

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:

  235
+  52
-----
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

Example
Function Call:

arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
Output:

   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
Function Call:

arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
Output:

  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
  
## Rules

The function will return the correct conversion if the supplied problems are properly formatted, otherwise, it will return a string that describes an error that is meaningful to the user.

## Development
Write your code in arithmetic_arranger.py. For development, you can use main.py to test your arithmetic_arranger() function. Click the "run" button and main.py will run.

## Testing
The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py. We are running the tests from test_module.py in main.py for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button. Alternatively you may run the tests by inputting pytest in the console.
